# Iron Journal Addon
## Description
Userscript to improve the Iron Journal websites ([Iron Journal](https://nboughton.uk/apps/ironsworn-campaign/#/) and [Iron Journal : Stargazer](https://nboughton.uk/apps/stargazer/#/)) created by [Nick Boughton](https://nboughton.uk/) and based on the [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) role-playing game created by [Shawn Tomkin](https://twitter.com/shawntomkin) :
- Adds a button next to the Campaign tab in order to quickly switch between campaigns. This is especially useful is co-op mode since the website does not allow the creation of different player characters and the only way to do it is to create several campaigns, each with its own character.
- Adds on the left of each progress track a plus and minus button in order to fill or remove a number of ticks depending on the rank of the progress track (e.g. three boxes for a troublesome, two ticks for an extreme track, etc.).
